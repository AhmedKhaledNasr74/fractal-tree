🌱 Click to add new branches—watch the tree grow with every click!
🌬️ Scroll up to send air from left to right, making the tree sway to the right.
🌬️ Scroll down, and the air reverses, swaying the tree to the left.
🌪️ And if you scroll up and down rapidly? The tree goes wild in both directions, with branches eventually shedding like leaves in the wind.
